This project is a Machine Learning–based Sales Prediction System that forecasts product sales based on advertisement spending.
The goal is to help understand how marketing investment influences sales performance and support better decision-making.
A Polynomial Regression model is trained on advertising data to learn the relationship between ad spend and sales. 
The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before training to improve model accuracy and reliability.
Once trained, the model can predict future sales based on new advertisement budgets.
The system includes an interactive user interface built with Gradio, allowing users to input advertisement spending and instantly receive predicted sales values.
The trained model is saved and deployed using Pickle, making it easy to reuse without retraining.
This project demonstrates practical skills in Machine Learning, data preprocessing, model deployment, and building simple ML web interfaces using Python.
